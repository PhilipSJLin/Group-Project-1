US Only Variation

Project Title: A Whirlwind Year, Inflation Trends and Impacts

Team Members: Anthony Parry, Colven Benjamin, Priya Jain, Philip Lin

Project Description:

We are doing a 3-part analysis of inflation:
1.	Inflation and unemployment rates over the last 20 years in the US based on CPI and BLS data points; Visual: line plot; Files: BLS API
Philip
2.	Interest rate and GDP over the last 20 years in the US based; Visual: line plot; Files: Fred API
Priya
(Merge points 1 and 2 into 1 table and plot)

3.1	Determine trend of interest rates in the US in relation to CPI/inflation over the last two years (24 months); Visual: scatter plot with regression line (as inflation increases, how are interest rates impacted?); Files: BLS CSV for data for last 24 months, FRED API for interest rate data points
Colven
3.2	Determine trend of unemployment rates for the US in relation to CPI/inflation over the last year (24 months); Visual: scatter plot with regression line (as inflation increases, how are unemployment rate impacted?); Files: BLS CSV for data for last 24 months, BLS API for interest rate data points

Future Considerations
Predictive model that can predict inflation levels (Extra Credit?)

Questions to answer:

What is the relationship between inflation, unemployment, interest and GDP rates in the US over the last 20 years? What inferences can we draw keeping in mind economic cycles?
How does CPI impact interest rates? And why?

What is the relationship between CPI and unemployment rates? What are some inferences we can draw from this data?

Can inflation be predicted?

Data Sets to be Used:
BLS API (Inflation/CPI, Unemployment)
BLS CSV (Data for last 24 months)
FRED API (Interest Rates, GDP)
