Conclusions

download CSVs and look at column
be specific about plots and questions
is scatter plot cpi vs inflation where each dot is a country
be as specific as possible
want one table with country year cpi and inflation
recommend only 1 or 2 merges of data
simplify a bit, try to be a little less ambitious

Project Title: A Whirlwind Year, Inflation Trends and Impacts

Team Members: Anthony Parry, Colven Benjamin, Priya Jain, Philip Lin

Project Description:
We are doing a 4-part analysis of inflation:
1.	Top 5 lowest and bottom 5 highest inflation countries based on CPI data points for Feb 2023 and their GDPs; Visual: table only; Files: BLS API, World Bank, IMF
2.	Determine trend of interest rates for top 20 lowest inflation countries in relation to CPI over the last year (12 months); Visual: scatter plot with regression line; Files: BLS/World Bank/IMF CSV for top 20 lowest inflation countries, FRED API/IMF for interest rate data points
3.	Determine trend of unemployment rates for the US in relation to CPI over the last year (12 months); Visual: line plot; Files: BLS API
4.	Predictive model that can predict inflation levels (?)

Questions to answer:
Where is inflation the highest and lowest? What is the GDP of these countries? What is the relationship of inflation and GDP?
How does CPI impact interest rates? And why?
What is the relationship between CPI  and unemployment rates? What are some inferences we can draw from this data?
Can inflation be predicted?

Data Sets to be Used:
BLS or IMF API (Inflation/CPI, Unemployment)
BLS or IMF CSV (Top 20 Lowest Inflation Countries Only)
FRED or IMF API (Interest Rates)
World Bank (GDP by Country)
