CPI and Unemployment Rate Analysis

This project analyzes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Unemployment Rate in the US over the last 24 months (from March 2021 to March 2023). The project includes a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the CPI and Unemployment Rate over time, as well as a regression line that represents the trend in the data.

Data Sources
The data used in this project was obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website. The CPI and Unemployment Rate data were downloaded as CSV files and processed using Pandas.

Results
The scatter plot shows a negative correlation between the CPI and Unemployment Rate, which is expected since a strong economy typically leads to higher CPI and lower unemployment. The regression line confirms this trend, indicating that as the CPI increases, the Unemployment Rate tends to decrease.

Conclusion
Overall, this project provides a simple analysis of the CPI and Unemployment Rate in the US over the last 24 months. While the analysis is limited in scope, it provides a starting point for further exploration of economic trends and indicators.
